=Installation=

It's not necessary to install anything to execute the tool, just executing the Python interpreter with peepdf.py. However, to use all its functionalities it's recommended the installation of some external packages.

The packages and libraries needed to have a full installation of peepdf are the following:

  * lzw (included in the package): library to encode/decode streams with the filter _/LZWDecode_.
  * python-spidermonkey (external): execution of Javascript code.
  * sctest (external): binary of the package Libemu to emulate the shellcode execution.

You can download the package from this URL and follow the instructions:

=== sctest (libemu) ===

It's not so easy as Spidermonkey, but it's not difficult. You can download the package from here:

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/nepenthes/files/libemu%20development/ http://sourceforge.net/projects/nepenthes/files/libemu development/]

The next step is to compile it and copy the sctest executable (tools/sctest) to the peepdf directory.
